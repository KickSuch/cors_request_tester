# CORS Request Tester
Utility website for testing frontend-backend communication. It tests making the request from the frontend using Fetch API as it would be used in the actual frontend. The difference from using something like Postman is that this will also check for CORS policy between your frontend and backend.
## Hosting
It is best to host it directly on the server that will be used as your frontend, but you can also test it with local hosting. Just be aware that opening your backend to localhost origin or a loopback address is dangerous. Use with caution.
